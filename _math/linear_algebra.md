# Bilinear and quadratic forms

--------------------

Find kernel of bilinear form with matrix $B$.

$\operatorname{Ker} \beta(x, y) = { y \vert \forall x \beta(x, y) = 0 }$
So we have $x^t B y = 0$ for all x. We can't just get rid of $x^t$.
But we can choose $x = By$, then we have $(By)^t By = 0$, which is dot product, this means $By=0$.
