$a_n = 4a_{n−1} − 5a_{n−2} + 2a_{n−3} + 3^n$
$a_n = 4a_{n−1} − 5a_{n−2} + 2a_{n−3} + 6$

# Descartes' rule of signs

<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Descartes'_rule_of_signs>

Number of positive roots is number of sign differences between consecutive nonzero coefficients, or is less than it by an even number.
Number of negative roots is counted in the same way by looking at $f(-x)$.

Non-real roots: if no root at 0, then minimum number is $n - (p + q)$.
