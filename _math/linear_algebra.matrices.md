# Symmetric matrices

Sum and difference of symmetric matrices are symmetric, while product is symmetric if and only if matrices commute: $AB = BA$.
Consequence:for symmetric $A$ the $A^n$ is also symmetric.

When $A^{-1}$ exists, it is symmetric if and only if $A$ is symmetric.

Any square matrix can uniquely be written as sum of a symmetric and a skew-symmetric matrix: $X = \frac{1}{2} \left( X+X^T \right) + \frac{1}{2} \left( X-X^{T} \right)$
